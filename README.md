# titan-project
Final project for Deep Learning

This is a deep learning project that explored the
different layers of an LLM. We studied the effects 
that using LoRa fine tuning on these layers had on 
fact retrieval and knowledge representation within
the model. 
note: this repo is a pool currently and will be 
refined and cleaned up to better represent codebase. 

report to follow.
